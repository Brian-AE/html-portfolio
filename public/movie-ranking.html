<h3>No Country for Old Men</h3>
<p>Great movie by the Cohen brothers. I think this would arguably be my favorite movie.</p>

<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>Robert Deniro is great as Travis Bickle in this film. I could listen to this soundtrack any day.</p>

<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>A great movie based off of the novela by Stephen King. I read the book and have seen the movie many times.</p>
